# Tic-Tac-Toe

#1st of April 2025

Built a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game, built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Supports two-player matches with a 5-round scoring system, player name inputs, and clean UI updates between rounds.

Implementing this project using modular JavaScript with IIFEs and factory functions was one of the biggest challenges. Trying to find which logic each module had to have was something completly new to me, especially the separation of concerns between splitting the logic and the DOM part, overall tho it made things a lot more clear and organized. 
Trying to understand how to make each module comunicate with each was also a really tough one to understand but It's probably due to the fact that I had to remember where each method was on each module and make it communicate with one another.
